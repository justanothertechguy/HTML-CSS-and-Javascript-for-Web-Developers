// STEP 6: Wrap the entire contents of SpeakGoodBye.js inside of an IIFE
// See Lecture 52, part 2


// STEP 7: Create an object, called 'byeSpeaker' to which you will attach
// the "speak" method and which you will expose to the global context
// See Lecture 52, part 1
var byeSpeaker = {};

// byeSpeaker object instead of being a standalone function.
// See Lecture 52, part 2
